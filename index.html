            <h1>The Truth</h1>

            <p>All that is true, we preach<br>
            as we lie in a bed of lies.<br>
            Twisting snakes know the way<br>
            to a dark crown, but colder still<br>
            is that bright gleam of truth.</p>

            <p>Cold fire and searing light<br>
            would burn even the saints away<br>
            to glittering dust in the sun.<br>
            And I'm no saint, so what should<br>
            that white ray do to me?</p>

            <p>And twice I spoke, twice a lie<br>
            on a pale and faded morning<br>
            where the singing birds were silent.<br>
            So perhaps my dark crown might stop<br>
            the advance of the sun.</p>

            <p>Or maybe as we plummet from Earth<br>
            and the beat of drums finally ends<br>
            a white wing might shroud us<br>
            and burn away. But the remnants<br>
            will be our parachutes.</p>

            <h1>A Raven</h1>

            <p>You may not leave<br>
            the battlefield grim<br>
            the light in your eyes dim<br>

            you must stay</p>

            <p>or so they say.</p>

            <p>Do not think it fine<br>
            to let wings fly dripping<br>
            to the sun above the world<br>
            you must stay

            <p>or so they say.</p>

            <p>Claim the right<br>
            to slip into endless night<br>
            and taste the fire<br>
            of endless light<br>

            <p>that's what they say.</p>

            <p>But if I decide to fly<br>
            breathless and tired<br>
            and speak to a raven<br>
            would he take me?</p>

            <p>or would I crumple to the ground?</p>

            <h1>A Quiet</h1>

            <p>There is a quiet in things unsaid;<br>
            a hole in the world where dark things spread<br>
            their wings to fly and gnaw and tear<br>
            and rip at what helps us hold dear.</p>

            <p>Speak twice your heart, or not at all,<br>
            but you must think on what enthralls<br>
            your tired soul never laid bare<br>
            and why you must not lose those cares.</p>

            <p>or they'll slip away, one fateful night -<br>
            all those hidden, dark delights.<br>
            Twixt your beaten, bloody fingers<br>
            naught but soft grey dust will linger.</p>

            <p>(and past the corners of your mind,<br>
            in the reflection of faded eyes,<br>
            you'll see a proud grey dragon await<br>
            his twice-forgotten final fate.)</p>

            <h1>Tears</h1>

            <p>but Why, she asks<br>
            no-one knows</p>

            <p>Why the mountains must<br>
            crumble into dust.</p>

            <p>Why the trees may crack and<br>
            die, parched by the sun</p>

            <p>while we water them<br>
            gently, with tears.</p>

            <h1>Ice</h1>

            <p>One day<br>
            the ice will break<br>
            and I'll fall into your arms<br>
            or into the empty embrace<br>
            of the end</p>

            <p>(don't wait too long)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="poemtext">
            <h1>Don't Wait</h1>

            <p>time to go out<br>
            the wide world awaits<br>
            fools dance in the wind<br>
            stones break against the shore<br>
            don't wait<br>
            or you will bend to the ground<br>
            and leave your head in the air</p>
