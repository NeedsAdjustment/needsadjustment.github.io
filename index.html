        <h1> idk </h1>
        
        <p>It's a three day weekend in a couple of days<br>
           Three days of lonely thinking about the grave<br>
           And I've finally stopped talking in my dreamless sleep<br>
           About good weather days where we might meet</p>

           <p>My usual ride's out of town again, and it's too<br>
           dark to walk all the way back home again, but I know you<br>
           won't sleep easy if I'm not blowing up your phone<br>
           so just let me go anyway, okay?</p>

            <p>Don't pretend like you know me, I was born feeling lonely<br>
            It's not the first time you've invited me over, and it's<br>
            Almost too early to start drinking hard liquor but<br>
            whatever gets you to stop ever touching my fingers</p>

            <p>And it's too late for this stupid ass poem to rhyme,<br>
            And I don't care that I haven't replied to your message tonight<br>
            And if my phone says "salut" again I swear I'll stop<br>
          playing Widowmaker so please just give me a break.</p></div>

            <h1>The Truth</h1>

            <p>All that is true, we preach<br>
            as we lie in a bed of lies.<br>
            Twisting snakes know the way<br>
            to a dark crown, but colder still<br>
            is that bright gleam of truth.</p>

            <p>Cold fire and searing light<br>
            would burn even the saints away<br>
            to glittering dust in the sun.<br>
            And I'm no saint, so how should<br>
            that white ray cleanse me?</p>

            <p>And twice I spoke, twice a lie<br>
            on a pale and faded morning<br>
            where the singing birds were silent.<br>
            So perhaps my dark crown might stop<br>
            the advance of the sun.</p>

            <p>Or maybe as we plummet from Earth<br>
            and the beat of drums finally ends<br>
            a white wing might shroud us<br>
            and burn away. But the remnants<br>
            shall be our parachutes.</p>

            <h1>A Raven</h1>

            <p>You may not leave<br>
            the battlefield grim<br>
            the light in your eyes dim<br>

            you must stay</p>

            <p>or so they say.</p>

            <p>Do not think it fine<br>
            to let wings fly dripping<br>
            to the sun above the world<br>
            you must stay

            <p>or so they say.</p>

            <p>Claim the right<br>
            to slip into endless night<br>
            and taste the fire<br>
            of endless light<br>

            <p>that's what they say.</p>

            <p>But if I decide to fly<br>
            breathless and tired<br>
            and speak to a raven<br>
            would he take me?</p>

            <p>or would I crumple to the ground?</p>

            <h1>A Quiet</h1>

            <p>There is a quiet in things unsaid;<br>
            a hole in the world where dark things spread<br>
            their wings to fly and gnaw and tear<br>
            and rip at what helps us hold dear.</p>

            <p>Speak twice your heart, or not at all,<br>
            but you must think on what enthralls<br>
            your tired soul never laid bare<br>
            and why you must not lose those cares.</p>

            <p>or they'll slip away, one fateful night -<br>
            all those hidden, dark delights.<br>
            Twixt your beaten, bloody fingers<br>
            naught but soft grey dust will linger.</p>

            <p>(and past the corners of your mind,<br>
            in the reflection of faded eyes,<br>
            you'll see a proud grey dragon await<br>
            his twice-forgotten final fate.)</p>

            <h1>Tears</h1>

            <p>but Why, she asks<br>
            no-one knows</p>

            <p>Why the mountains must<br>
            crumble into dust.</p>

            <p>Why the trees may crack and<br>
            die, parched by the sun</p>

            <p>while we water them<br>
            gently, with tears.</p>

            <h1>Ice</h1>

            <p>One day<br>
            the ice will break<br>
            and I'll fall into your arms<br>
            or into the empty embrace<br>
            of the end</p>

            <p>(don't wait too long)</p>

            <h1>Don't Wait</h1>

            <p>time to go out<br>
            the wide world awaits<br>
            fools dance in the wind<br>
            stones break against the shore<br>
            don't wait<br>
            or you will bend to the ground<br>
            and leave your head in the air</p>
