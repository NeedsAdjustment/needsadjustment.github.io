            <h1>oh dear</h1>

            <p>Oh dear<br />
She's almost here<br />
My poems done<br />
But will she care?</p>
<p>Oh dear<br />
Do I dare<br />
To tell her<br />
How I feel</p>

            <h1>Your Wrong</h1>

            <p>Your wrong he said<br />
With nothing in his head<br />
But once my poems <br />
he had read <br />
He became as mad as Big Ed</p>

            <h1>Helen Hunt</h1>

            <p>Your elegant<br />
Like Helen Hunt<br />
But poetry like this<br />
Is beyond you</p>

            <h1>uni</h1>

            <p>Who needs a degree?<br />
Certainly not me<br />
People try and get by with a C<br />
But all I need is the TV</p>

            <h1>Little Bit of Luke</h1>

            <p>I knew a boy<br />
Fresh off the boat, <br />
Whomst did enjoy<br />
My poems wrote</p>

<p>His name was Luke,<br />
And Luke he was<br />
But just a little<br />
Herein because</p>

<p>As is his wont<br />
In sad music he sits<br />
Lets emo Luke out<br />
But just in little bits</p>

<p>Cos when he does<br />
He must let flow<br />
Only a little emo luke<br />
Lest too depressed he grow</p>
